<h1><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as a <strong>Git submodule</strong> plus <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit 2</a> configuration.</h1>

<p>This is a fully functional Codekit 2 configuration for Bootstrap as a submodule, Bower and Gulp.</p>

<h2>Gulp</h2>

<p>Gulp is used to prepare the project after a Bootstrap submodule update and to copy relevant files into a dist folder for publishing purposes:</p>

<p><code>$ gulp prepare</code> after a Bootstrap update, just copies the relevant js files into the <code>js</code> folder.</p>

<p><code>$ gulp dist</code> copy your web app in a new <code>dist</code> folder wich contains only the relevant file stripping out source files.</p>
