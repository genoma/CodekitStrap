[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a __Git submodule__ plus [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)!
===========================================================================================================================

A pretty smart frontend complete tool to develop faster and better, fully extensible with Bower (contains Angular, jQuery), easily deployable with Gulp (support for Less, Coffeescript, Sourcemaps) and integrated with [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/).

## BETA

This framework is currently in a *beta* stage.

## Install

Clone the repo, add your branch and your own remote and you're pretty much ready to develop your own web app.

## Howto

`$ gulp` launch gulp from terminal to compile, preview and work on your web app.

`$ gulp prepare` after a Bootstrap submodule update copies all the javascript files into the project root folder.

`$ gulp minify` minify and ugilfy respectively css and javascript.

`$ gulp dist` put relevant files into the dist folder to deploy your work.

## Contributing

Any sort of contribution is more than welcome, just fork the project and add your own fixes or improvements.
